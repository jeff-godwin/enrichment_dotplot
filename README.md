# enrichment_dotplot
Plotting enrichment of pathways, gene ontologies etc using ggplot2. Dotplot is similar to the one generated by ClusterProfiler after enrichkegg and enrichgo funtions. 

It works on R version 3.6 and higher. ggplot2 has to be pre-installed.

Pathway enrichment analysis for specific genelists may be obtained from tools such as ClusterProfiler, GSEA and DAVID functional annotation.

Input file should have 4 columns with the following headers -

Type  Count  Value  P-value

Type - pathway term
Count - no of enriched genes
Value - Fold enrichment/enrichment ratio
P-value - statistical p-value, q-value or FDR
